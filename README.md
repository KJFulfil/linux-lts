# embeddedTS Linux LTS Repository

Here we maintain LTS Linux kernel support for many of our platforms. Each other branch in this repository is a copy of the branch in the upstream kernel with patches applied on top where necessary to support devices. Additionally, as we do tested builds, these are tagged here.

As part of our life cycle policy, we strive to provide both a locked-in stock image on every shipped device (once it reaches the Fully Developed Product stage) as well as provide software updates through the lifetime of the product. This repository houses our maintained LTS kernels. See our [Product Life cycle Policy](https://www.embeddedts.com/about/product-lifecycle) as well as our [Board Support Software](https://www.embeddedts.com/software) pages for more information on these.

This repository currently does not contain any of our stock kernels at this time. This may change over time as we release new hardware targeting upstream LTS kernels as opposed to vendor supplied kernels. See your device's respective [product manual](https://docs.embeddedts.com/) for information on how to build its stock kernel and any LTS kernels or distributions that are supported.
